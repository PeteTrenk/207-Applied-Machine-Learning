    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "This is a very high dimensional data set (relative to obsersvations) we're trying to model against. Nearest neighbors is trying to find the shortest token-frequency distances between the train and test data to predict the document's topic. There are high frequencies of tokens (words) shared across all topics which are not as informative and may be modeled better with larger k values. But there are also many low-frequency words unique to each topic that are very informative and better modeled with lower k values. The knn model needs to learn which features are more important than others. But distance isn't an ideal metric for doing so given the two contrasting behaviors mentioned above.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a discriminative model, meaning it learns the conditional probability distribution of the topic given the feature. Naive Bayes is a generative model, meaning it learns the joint probability distribution of the topic and a feature. Because of the relatively narrow sample size of each feature, the discriminative model won't generalize as well as the generative model. Although the logistic regression model will have lower bias, it has a higher variance than the naive bayes model in this case and so it doesn't generalize as well.\n",

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular.

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
